This is the source code for [MathQuiz!](https://mathquiz.tk/), the web port of my first Android app, which I created during 7th grade. It's written entirely using Javascript and HTML, uses Google's [Material Components for the Web](https://material.io/develop/web) framework for styling, and is hosted on a global Google CDN using Firebase.

# Features
- Asks the user questions about math questions, configurable between Addition, Integer Subtraction, Subtraction (with only positive numbers and results), and Multiplication
- Comes preconfigured with a timer of 10 seconds per question, customizable on the app's main screen
- Gives the user a score depending on how many questions they get right before missing a question or running out of time, awards 5 points per question
- Is an entirely static application, doesn't require any server-based deployment
- Is a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Developer_guide/Installing) and therefore can be installed from the browser on Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, or any desktop Linux distribution using either Chrome, Firefox (Android only), Microsoft Edge, Safari (using "Add to Home Screen" on iOS only), Opera Mobile, UC Browser, or Samsung Internet.
